Hi, I am Chloe (Thuy) Tran. I am a Bioinformatics Data Analyst at Huntsman Cancer Institute, The University of Utah.My research is focusing on cell-cell interaction, treatment prediction and drug re-position as well as analyze single cell data to identify significant of genes  expression differences across cell types based on responses and time point. Besides, I am also a web developer, I'm working on the JAVA script based website for single cell data interaction visualization.
